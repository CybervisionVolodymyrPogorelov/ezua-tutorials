You could serve the model through an endpoint to allow others and/or frontend applications to use it? Perhaps you'd want to use it as a base model to train a whole new model with a whole new dataset? \n",

    "\n",
    "Storing your models in a Model Registry has many major advantages, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Storage**: Just like a library stores books, a model registry stores trained machine learning models. These models are like the recipes you create to solve specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Control**:  As you experiment and improve your models, you create new versions. A model registry keeps track of all these different versions, allowing you to compare them and see which one performs best and \"rollback\" if future experiments give an undesirable output. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation**:  In addition to the models themselves, a registry can store important information about each model, like the data it was trained on, its performance metrics, and who created it. This documentation helps everyone understand what the model does and how it was built.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration**:  A model registry acts as a central hub for data scientists and engineers working on the same project. They can all access and use the models stored there, making collaboration smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment**:  Once you've chosen the best model version, the registry can help you deploy it into production, meaning you can use it to make real-world predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, a model registry helps organizations manage the lifecycle of their machine learning models, from creation to deployment. It ensures everyone's on the same page, models are well-documented, and the best versions are easily accessible."
