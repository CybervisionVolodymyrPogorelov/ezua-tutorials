# Banking Fraud Detection

Fraudulent activity has permeated multiple sectors, from e-commerce and healthcare to banking and payment systems. This illicit industry amasses billions every year and is on an upward trajectory. The 2018 global economic crime survey by PwC [1] verifies this assertion, revealing that 49 percent of the 7,200 enterprises surveyed had fallen prey to some form of fraudulent conduct.

It is therefore crucial that organizations can respond to such threats in a timely manner. With HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics, fraud detection teams can immediately get started on training enterprise-grade prediction models and deploy them to analytics applications with ease. After all, no organization wants thsir specialist teams spending days or weeks setting up the environments - they should be catching fraudsters!

In this tutorial, you will leverage a suite of tools deployed through HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics to train a Machine Learning (ML) model that can detect fraudulent transactions. This model will be trained using the Banksim dataset [2], a synthetically created dataset which features a combination of various customer payments, made at different intervals and
in varying amounts. Using this dataset and the appropriate tools, you will create an automated system that can detect and curtail fraudulent
activities with high accuracy.

#### This demo will showcase how to leverage the following tools on HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics:
- Minio S3 Buckets
- Kubeflow Pipelines
- Kserve
- scikit-learn
  
To run this tutorial, **you will need access to a HPE Ezmeral Unified Anaytics** cluster. 



## Getting Started

1. Login to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics using your credentials.
1. In the sidebar navigation menu, select "Notebooks". Click "New Notebook Server".
1. Name the notebook 'fraud-detection', then select the "Custom Notebook" dropdown menu. Under the "Image" dropdown, select the image containing `jupyter-data-science`. Allocate at least 4Gi of memory, then click "Launch". 
1. Connect to the Notebook server using the Play button on your newly created notebook. 
1. Under "Other" on the main page, launch a new terminal window. 
1. Clone the HPE Ezmeral Demo repository locally.  
      ```
        git clone https://github.com/HPEEzmeral/ezua-tutorials.git
        ```
1. Navigate to the tutorial's directory (`ezua-tutorials/demos/fraud-detection`).
1. Create the virtual environment:
    - Deactivate the base conda environment:
        ```
        conda deactivate
        ```
    - Create a new virtual environment:
       ```
       python -m venv fraud-detection
       ```
    - Activate the new virtual environment:
       ```
       source fraud-detection/bin/activate
       ```
    - Upgrade `pip`:
       ```
       pip install --upgrade pip
       ```
    - Install the dependencies:
       ```
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
    - Add the new conda environment as an ipykernel:
       ```
       python -m ipykernel install --user --name=fraud-detection
       ```
    - Refresh your browser tab to access the updated environment.
1. Open the `fraud-detection.ipynb` notebook file.
1. Follow along through the notebook. 

## How does it work?

A dataset is copied from the globally-accessible HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric into an local S3 bucket (MinIO). To deal with imbalanced datasets which are common in fraud detection (where fraudulent transactions are far less than legitimate ones), oversampling is performed to increase the number of samples in the minority class. The dataset then undergoes preparation, which involves cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and testing datasets. Various models are trained using the training dataset using a variety of ML techniques and their performance is validated using the testing dataset. 

The trained models are stored back in the HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric, making them globally available not just to any application within the HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics stack, but to whoever may need them, wherever they may be. The best-performing model is then selected from the stored models to be served using Kserve for making transaction predictions. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics container-based infrastructure layer enables KServe to scale the model deployment to service as many clients as is required at any given time. The served model is used to make inferences, which means predicting whether new transactions are fraudulent or not. The best inference model is deployed into an application, analogous to a live banking system, to automatically detect and flag fraudulent transactions in real-time.

The workflow is supported by HPE Ezmeral Software for data availabilty, Jupyter Notebook for interactive computing and creating ML models, and Kubeflow for orchestrating the ML workflows. HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics hosts, deploys and connects all of these pieces of software through a managed and monitored container-based infrastructure layer that can support the development, training, and deployment of large-scale data workflows.

## Clean Up

To clean up the resources used during this experiment, go to the Kubeflow Endpoints UI and delete the `fraud-detection` ISVC that was generated by the pipeline run.
