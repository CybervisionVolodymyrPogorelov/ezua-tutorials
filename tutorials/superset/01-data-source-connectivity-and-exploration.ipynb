    "\n",
    "- **Data Sources:** View and access connected data sources; create new data source connections.\n",
    "- **Data Catalog:** Select data sets (tables and views) from one or more data sources and query data across the data sets. You can cache data sets. Caching stores the data in a distributed caching layer within the data fabric for accelerated access to the data.\n",
    "- **Query Editor:** Run queries against selected data sets; create views and new schemas.\n",
    "- **Cached Assets:** Lists the cached data sets (tables and views).\n",
    "- **Airflow Pipelines:** Links to the Airflow interface where you can connect to data sets created in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and use them in your data pipelines."
