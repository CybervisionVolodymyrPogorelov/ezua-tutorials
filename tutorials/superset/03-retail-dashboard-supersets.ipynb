    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an end-to-end workflow example for a retail store analysis scenario in HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software using EzPresto and Superset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A data analyst for a large retailer wants to visualize data sets from MySQL, SQL Server and Hive data sources in Superset. The analyst signs in to HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software and connects Unified Analytics to MySQL, SQL Server, and Hive data sources. The analyst then runs a federated query against the data sets before creating a view from the query. The analyst accesses the view from Superset and uses it to visualize the data in a bar chart and adds the chart to a dashboard. Now, they have a complete and customized view of the retailer's operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics Software includes the following components and applications to support an end-to-end workflow for this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "**EzPresto**: An MPP SQL query engine that runs accelerated queries against connected data sources and returns results to Superset for visualization. EzPresto connects to Superset through a database connection, enabling direct access to the data sources connected to Unified Analytics from Superset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Superset**: An analytics dashboarding application that communicates with EzPresto to send queries and receive the query results needed to visualize data from the selected data sets.\n",
